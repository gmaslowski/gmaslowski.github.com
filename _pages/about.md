ðŸš€ **CTO at Saga Tenix AS** | From *Developer* to *Architect* to **CTO**â€”Driving Electrification and Innovation ðŸŒ±

My journey began as a **Java Software Developer**, evolving through roles as a **Software Architect**, and now as **CTO**. Along the way, Iâ€™ve mastered *JVM languages* like **Java**, **Scala**, **Groovy**, and **Kotlin**, while expanding my skills in **JavaScript** and **C#**. Throughout it all, Iâ€™ve remained passionate about cutting-edge technologyâ€”especially in the realm of **EV electrification** and **sustainable tech**.

Today, I lead the charge (literally) in the **electrification of fleet management** at **Saga Tenix**, developing innovative solutions for **charging infrastructure** and **sustainable transportation**. My focus is on harnessing the power of **EV technology** to revolutionize fleet operations, ensuring theyâ€™re cleaner, smarter, and more efficient.

As **CTO**, I manage the **IT Software Development team**, oversee **technology operations**, and align **IT strategies** with **business goals**. I'm responsible for **IT budget management**, **infrastructure development**, and **system implementation**, always keeping an eye on performance and continuous improvement. I believe in growing teams that deliver high-impact, sustainable tech solutionsâ€”whether itâ€™s through *cloud technologies* (**AWS**, **Azure**), orchestrating with **Docker/Kubernetes**, or driving innovation in **EV tech**.

Of course, my geeky side still thrives with **Go**, *bleeding-edge tech*, and **ESP8266** projects, keeping me sharp. When not in the office, Iâ€™m a *sim racing enthusiast* and **F1** fan, pushing limits on the virtual track just like I do in the world of **EV innovation**.

<br/>
<br/>
But hey... being a geek with attraction to <b>Go</b>, bleeding egde technologies and <b>ESP8266</b> isn't a crime. Guilty of that as well ;)
