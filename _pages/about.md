<p>    
ðŸš€ <strong>CTO at Saga Tenix AS</strong> | From <em>Developer</em> to <em>Architect</em> to <strong>CTO</strong>â€”Driving Electrification and Innovation ðŸŒ±
</p>
<p>
My journey began as a <strong>Java Software Developer</strong>, evolving through roles as a <strong>Software Architect</strong>, and now as <strong>CTO</strong>. Along the way, Iâ€™ve mastered <em>JVM languages</em> like <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Scala</strong>, <strong>Groovy</strong>, and <strong>Kotlin</strong>, while expanding my skills in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>. Throughout it all, Iâ€™ve remained passionate about cutting-edge technologyâ€”especially in the realm of <strong>EV electrification</strong> and <strong>sustainable tech</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Today, I lead the charge (literally) in the <strong>electrification of fleet management</strong> at <strong>Saga Tenix</strong>, developing innovative solutions for <strong>charging infrastructure</strong> and <strong>sustainable transportation</strong>. My focus is on harnessing the power of <strong>EV technology</strong> to revolutionize fleet operations, ensuring theyâ€™re cleaner, smarter, and more efficient.
</p>
<p>
As <strong>CTO</strong>, I manage the <strong>IT Software Development team</strong>, oversee <strong>technology operations</strong>, and align <strong>IT strategies</strong> with <strong>business goals</strong>. I'm responsible for <strong>IT budget management</strong>, <strong>infrastructure development</strong>, and <strong>system implementation</strong>, always keeping an eye on performance and continuous improvement. I believe in growing teams that deliver high-impact, sustainable tech solutionsâ€”whether itâ€™s through <em>cloud technologies</em> (<strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Azure</strong>), orchestrating with <strong>Docker/Kubernetes</strong>, or driving innovation in <strong>EV tech</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, my geeky side still thrives with <strong>Go</strong>, <em>bleeding-edge tech</em>, and <strong>ESP8266</strong> projects, keeping me sharp. When not in the office, Iâ€™m a <em>sim racing enthusiast</em> and <strong>F1</strong> fan, pushing limits on the virtual track just like I do in the world of <strong>EV innovation</strong>.
